run dune build to build the game, then run dune exec src/terminal.exe to run the game. There are no any other
libraries used. 

Reference: I was stuck when implementing game.ml, so I looked at the https://github.com/zbcszr/Mahjong
repo for inspiration. I studied the picture they draw on README and the mli files they wrote, 
and used their logic to simulate a round.
